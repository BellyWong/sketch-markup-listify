## Roadmap & Feature Ideas

* [ ] Build relations between text layers and its sub-groups.
* [ ] Create an option to select the type of lists tag, like, `ul`, `ol` or `option`.
* [ ] Create an option to select the tags that might need to be inserted inside `li` tag, like, for example, `li > a`, `li > p`, `li > span`, etc.
* [ ] Find a solution for handling invisible layers or group of layers. 
* [ ] Create an option to copy Pug (old Jade) and Handlebars.
* [ ] Create an option to copy the JSON corresponding to the selection made.
* [ ] Consider the possibility of creating pasteable markup lists with images, text and shapes.
* [ ] Consider the possibility of developing the inverse action, i.e., have a HTML list and be able to convert it into groups and/or text layers.
